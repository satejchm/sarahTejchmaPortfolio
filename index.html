          <h1>I'm ready to create with you today!</h1>
          <p>Hi, i'm Sarah! I have a bachelors in media arts and science and am looking for a job to help expand my experience and creativity. What drives me is my love for art, ever since I was young I loved any way I could express my creativity. I hope to find a job where I can help others meet their goals and also express my creativity and grow through my work. I specialize in web design and development, graphic design, and interaction design. I had mostly focused on web design but ended up falling in love with graphic art and graphic design. If you need someone with a creative mind who loves to collaborate and help others succeed you've come to the right place!</p>

              This site was a senior project I worked on using Jquery and firebase to create a working database. It shows to capability to enter information to store in a database as well as some different ways to lay out a site.

                  This site was where I started to learn how to integrate jquery into my site code. It is an exciting and beneficial way to create websites that is easy to understand and interperet. There are a lot of different elements displayed through out the site.

            This site was a collaboration with my peers Billy Mcintyre and Drew
            Coble. All things shown I am capable of recreating and is a great
            way for all three of us to showcase our abilities when working as a

                  This site was based upon design made by one of my peers. I coded everything in the website to create the site based upon the wireframe/prototype example pages given. It is based upon a travel sight where you can purchase multiple different flight tours.
